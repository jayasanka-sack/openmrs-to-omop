## Setting Up Git LFS for This Repository

This repository uses **Git Large File Storage (LFS)** to handle large files like `CONCEPT.csv`. If you're cloning or pulling the repository, make sure to set up Git LFS to download the actual files instead of pointers.

### Step 1: Install Git LFS
Before cloning, install Git LFS:

- **macOS (Homebrew)**  
  ```sh
  brew install git-lfs
  ```

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install git-lfs
  ```

- **Windows**  
  Download and install Git LFS from [Git LFS official site](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
After installing Git LFS, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
```

Git LFS will automatically download the large files.

### Step 3: Pulling Updates
If you have already cloned the repository before installing Git LFS, or if you are pulling new changes, run:

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

This ensures all large files are properly downloaded.

### Troubleshooting
If you see pointer files instead of actual data when opening a large file (e.g., `CONCEPT.csv`), it means Git LFS is not set up correctly. Run:

```sh
git lfs pull
```

For more information, refer to the [Git LFS documentation](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
